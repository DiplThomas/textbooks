All of these regions in the Voronoi diagram are examples of polygons. A polygon is a closed, two-dimensional shape with straight sides that do not cross each other. A polygon does not have any holes in the shape. Click on a card below and drag it to the “Polygon” or “Non Polygon” side.

    include ../shared/components/ab.pug

{div.card(solution="a")} Card #1 - Regular Polygon

{div.card(solution="b")} Card #2 - NOT a Polygon __bold__ `x+y`

{div.card(solution="b")} Card #9 - Not a polygon

{div.card(solution="a")} Card #10 - Irregular Polygon

{div.card(solution="a" hint="This is not correct. Try again!")} Card #11 - Polygon
