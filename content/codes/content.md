## Introduction

> id: introduction

Imagine you’re in the jungle, being held hostage. You’ve been there for three months and you’re losing hope. You just want to be free and see your family again. A song comes on the radio. You hear a secret message in the song that gives you reason to believe you will be rescued soon. But your captors have no idea. How might you get this message that someone else can’t hear?

Listen to a clip of this song and see if you can find a hidden message (hint: the message is hidden after the chorus, at around 1:20):

    figure: iframe(width="100%" height=166 scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/184253099&color=%23295869&auto_play=false&hide_related=true&show_comments=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false&sharing=false&download=false&show_playcount=false")



It may be very difficult for the untrained ear to notice, but there is a secret message hidden in the song. There are lots of cases in the world where we want to communicate but we can't use our voices or our text, or we want to conceal our message from others.

### Morse Code

Before we resolve our "hostage situation", let's try a thought experiment that's a bit safer. Imagine you and your friend who live across the street want a way to communicate at night time, without using phones or computers and without waking your family members. You both have flashlights which can be turned either off or on. How might you communicate with each other?

{.todo} A flashlight SVG with an on/off button (see the "conic section" section for an existing flashlight) {.caption} experiment with ways you might communicate using just a flashlight.

One way we might communicate is by turning it on for different lengths of time, to represent different letters.

> id: telegraph

A similar technique was invented around the year 1837 by [Samuel Morse](bio:morse) after the invention of the [electric telegraph](gloss:telegraph).

::: column.grow

The electric telegraph can send electrical messages across long distances. In 1861, a wire was built across the U.S. across which messages could be sent from coast to coast nearly instantly. Before telegraphs, messages could take hundreds of days to reach one coast from the other.

Like in our flashlight scenario, the people who could work with telegraph could communicate in a very limited medium. Telegraphs work when you press down and connect a circut (on), or let go and disconnect the circuit (off).

Samuel Morse came up with a way to represent the letters of our alphabet by sequences of short beeps (dots) and long beeps (dashes). Each letter has a different sequence.

    .alphabet
      for letter, index in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('')
        div
         strong= letter
         x-morse(char=letter)

For example, to signal an E we would make a [[dot|dash]]. To signal a Y we would make a [[dash dot dash dash|dot dash dash|dot dot]].

> id: morse-encoding

The most well-known message sent in Morse Code is “SOS”, which is the emergency help message. SOS can be sent by 3 dots (S), 3 dashes (O), and 3 dots (S).

Returning to our original hostage situation, it is [Morse Code](gloss:morse-code) that the creators of that song used to conceal their message. This was the message:

    x-code-box
      .output.morse
      .input(contenteditable="false" spellcheck="false") 19 LIBERADOS. SIGUEN USTEDES. ANIMO.

{.fixme} CHECK COPYRIGHT

Translated from Spanish, the message is __19 PEOPLE RESCUED. YOU'RE NEXT. DON'T GIVE UP.__

    x-video(src="images/BetterDaysClip.mp4" poster="images/BetterDays.jpg" width=320 height=180 audio controls credit="YouTube")

Let's try listening to the song again. To someone who does not understand Morse Code, it may just sound like part of the music. But the hostages were soldiers who had been trained in Morse Code, and recognized it in the song when they heard it on the radio. They used their training to understand the message and prepared to be rescued. They were rescued and returned home safely. You never know when knowing Morse Code will come in handy!

### Codes and Information

{.fixme} __Information__ is everywhere around us, but it is difficult to define what
exactly "information" _means_. Instead we can give examples of things that
contain information: books and newspapers, numbers and charts, images, sound or
film clips.

{.fixme} __Codes__ are rules or algorithms to express information in certain formats. Our
alphabet is a example of a code can can be used to express _language_ in the
form of _letters_.


::: column(width=191)
    x-img(src="images/native-telegraph.jpg" width=191 height=240)

::: column.grow

Codes are not a recent invention. For example, indigenous cultures used smoke signals to communicate messages over long distances where it was too far to shout.

:::

{.fixme} Sometimes letters are not the best format to express information, and we can use
other codes. In this course we will discover some of these codes as well as the
algorithms to encode and decode messages.

{.fixme} What we just communicated with was __morse code__.

Here are some more codes that are used commonly.

#### NATO Phonetic Alphabet
The NATO Phonetic Alphabet is used to communicate letters over radio by people like military, police, or EMS workers. Instead of saying a letter, we say its respective word. It might be used to communicate something like a license plate. 

    .alphabet
      for letter, index in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.split('')
        div
         strong= letter
         +nato(letter, index)

#### Flag Semaphore

__Flag Semaphore__ is used for communicating letters over long distances. It was used before the invention of the telegraph.

The Beatles wanted to use Semaphore to spell the word "HELP" on the cover of their album with the same name. They didn't like the way it looked, so they chose different letters. What do their signals actually spell?

#### Genetic Code
{.fixme} The genetic code is what makes up our DNA. There are 4 different nucleotides. You may see a string of something like __CGATCGTTACGCGATTCGATCATTTGTGTCCATCGTGGG__. This is a _code_ for a sequence of molecules within a strand of DNA. In this case, the _letter_ is the code representing the nucleotide.

    .alphabet
      - words = ['Adenine', 'Thymine', 'Cytosine', 'Guanine']
      for letter, index in 'ATCG'
        div
          div
            img(src="images/dna/dna_" + words[index] + ".png", width="100px", height="100px")
            span= words[index]
          strong= letter

The same symbol can mean different things within completely different codes. For example, the letter __C__ can be represented by "Charlie" in the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, __this maritime flag__, __these arms__, or it can represent Cytosine if placed within a strand of other DNA letters.

### Fingers

How high can you count using only one hand, without skipping any numbers? When we count with our hands, we traditionally use how many fingers are up to represent the number. We have five fingers, so that means the highest we can count with one hand is [[five|four|ten]].

::: column.grow
A drawback of this strategy is that there are many unused finger combinations. For example, this finger combination to the right would represent [[2]]. With our traditional model there are two fingers up, so it means two. But we already have a configuration for two! We're wasting valuable space.

{.todo} could possibly show a // TABLE with all the extra values...

What if there was a way that we could count much higher while still using only one hand? The secret lies in something called [binary numbers](gloss:binary-numbers). Instead of using the number of fingers up as our count, we have to do something a bit more complicated. We can treat each of our fingers as a __digit__ with one of two possible values: down or up. Down can represent the number __0__ and up can represent the number __1__.

If we want to use each combination of ups and downs to represent a different number, then how many combinations can we represent?

{.todo} Transistors


A [transistor](gloss:transistor) is like a switch than can be either on or off. Recall how in our morse code/flashlight examples we were constrained by the medium’s ability to be on or off. Computers store data in transistors, so they store data as a collection of ons and offs, or 1s and 0s. Just like we just did with our fingers (by putting them up or down). If a computer had fingers (up/down), they would probably count to 31 on one hand. Everything that’s stored on a computer, from text and images to video and sound is stored in transistors as sequences of 1s and 0s, or binary code.


---

### Binary to Base-Ten

Before we can understand how computers use binary code to store complex things like sound and video, we must first understand the basics, like how a base-ten number is stored.

Our number system operates as a [base ten](gloss:base-10) number system. Base ten numbers have ten possible values for each digit. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. In a base-ten number, each digit is worth ten times as much as the previous smaller digit. The first right-most digit represents how many [[ones|tens|twos]] there are, the second right-most digit represents how many [[tens|hundreds|fives]] there are, and so on.

| number | hundreds value | tens value | ones value |
| 432 | [[400]] | [[30]] | [[2]] |
| 907 | [[900]] | [[0]] | [[7]] |

---

Recall that binary numbers do not operate on the base ten number system, but a base-two number system. They do not have ten possible digit values, they only have [[2|1|5]]. In base-ten, each digit value increases by a multiple of ten (e.g. one hundred is ten times ten). However in binary, each digit value increases by a multiple of [[2]].

Let's examine the binary number that is 5 consecutive 1s. How much is each digit worth?

| __{.m-red}digit__ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| __{.m-green}digit value__   | [[16]] | [[8]] | [[4]] | [[2]] | [[1]] |
{.table-small.grid}

---

So the full value of binary number 11111 is not eleven thousand, one-hundred and eleven, but is 

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = [[31]]

---

Here are some 6-digit binary numbers. Let's convert them to decimal.

{.text-center} _{.ns.b}100110_ = _{.ns.b}[[32]]_ + _{.ns.lb}0_ + _{.ns.lb}0_ + _{.ns.b}[[4]]_ + _{.ns.b}[[2]]_ + _{.ns.lb}0_ = _{.ns.b}[[38]]_

{.text-center} _{.ns.y}111000_ = _{.ns.y}[[32]]_ + _{.ns.y}[[16]]_ + _{.ns.y}[[8]]_ + _{.ns.ly}0_ + _{.ns.ly}0_ + _{.ns.ly}0_ = _{.ns.y}[[56]]_

{.text-center} _{.ns.g}101011_ = _{.ns.g}[[32]]_ + _{.ns.lg}0_ + _{.ns.g}[[8]]_ + _{.ns.lg}0_ + _{.ns.g}[[2]]_ + _{.ns.g}[[1]]_ = _{.ns.g}[[43]]_

### Converting Base-Ten to Binary

Now that we know how to convert a binary to decimal, how can we convert a decimal to a binary code?

Follow the slideshow below.

{.fixme} make this design more consistent with the rest of Mathigon

    x-slideshow
      .stage.cheesecake(slot="stage")
        figure: include svg/ch.svg
      .legend(slot="legend") We have a full block of length #[strong 25]f.
      .legend(slot="legend") We always start with the leftmost digit. In this case, 16 is the largest power of 2 that can fit into 25. So first we test the #[strong 16s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We subtract 16, so we write a #[strong 1] in the 16s place. We're left with #[strong 9].
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 8s] place. 
      .legend(slot="legend") We can subtract 8, so we write a #[strong 1] in the 8s place. We're left with #[strong 1].
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 4s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We cannot subtract 4, so we write a #[strong 0] in the 4s place.
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 2s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We cannot subtract 2, so we write a #[strong 0] in the 2s place.
      .legend(slot="legend") Next we test the #[strong 1s] place.
      .legend(slot="legend") We can subtract 1, so we write a #[strong 1] in the 1s place. We're left with 0, and we are finished.


Here is that simple method put into steps. 
// BUTTER: format it
When converting decimal number N into binary:
1. Start with the highest power of 2^n, d, that you can subtract from N. 
2. If you can subtract d from N, then write a 1 in that place and continue with N = N - d.
3. If you cannot subtract d from N, then write a 0 in that place and continue with N = N.
4. Divide d by 2 to get the next digits place.
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you have written the 1s place.

We've seen decimal, we've seen binary, but you can create a number system with any base. Cmoputers use something called a "hexidecimal" or base-16 number system to store colors. (// TODO: image of color palette with their hexidecimal colors on the right.)

Sports leagues often use tournaments where the number of teams is a power of two. The NCAA basketball tournament begins with 64 teams. Each round, half of the teams are eliminated. The rounds of 16, 8, and 4 are called respectively the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Eight, and the Final Four. (// TODO: image of bracket)

The I-Ching is an ancient Chinese divination text. Each I-Ching "Hexagram" is made of six horizontal lines, each of which can be either solid (Yang) or divided (Yin). There are 64 possible Hexagrams (2^6). (// TODO: image of I-Ching)

Some codes are designed in a way that only

Alice and Bob

The science of creating secret codes is called __Cryptography__ and the are of
breaking them is called __Cryptanalysis__.

When designing ciphers, there are several possible objectives:

* __Secrecy:__ A and B can be sure that no third party X can read the message.
* __Integrity:__ A and B can be sure that no third party X can alter the message
  while it is being transmitted.
* __Secrecy:__ B can be sure that the message actually comes from A, and not
  from some impostor.

### The Caesar Cipher

{.todo} TODO

The diagram below shows how plaintext letters [{.letter.plain} *] are converted
into cipher letters [{.letter.cipher} *]. The chart also shows the relative
frequency of every letter in your text, as well as the entire english language.

    .code-play
      .freq-table-wrap
        .freq-table
          .freq-table-chart
            each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
              .freq-col
                .letter-bar.plain
                .letter-bar.real
          .freq-table-plain
            each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
              .freq-col: .letter.plain= l
          .freq-table-cipher
            each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
              .freq-col
            #letter-slider(data-slide-width="26")
              each l in ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').split('')
                .freq-col: .letter.cipher= l
      .row
        .code-area.grow
          h3.code-title Plain Text
          .plain-text(contenteditable="true", placeholder="Start typing to create your first cypher …")
        .code-area.grow
          h3.code-title Enciphered Text
          .cipher-text

Once you know the pattern the Caesar cipher is very easy to break: you just have
to try all <25> possibilities. Try to decode the following secret messages:

### Substitution Cipher

It is not hard to make the Caesar cipher more secure: rather than shifting the
letters we could scramble all of them randomly. Now there are not only 25 but
26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000 possibilities. Even using a computer
it would take very long to check all possible combinations.

But it turns out that if we have a sufficiently long section of text, even the
substitution cipher is easy to crack – using what we know about the language of
the original plaintext.

In every language, some letters are more common than others. This means that the
ciphertext should also contain some letters more often than others.
